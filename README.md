# Setup Instructions

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn dev` to start the development instance
- Go to http://localhost:3000 to view the development instance
- Run `yarn test` to run tests

# Requirements

- Display 30 public repositories
- Show name, description, languages, and issues
- Click the repository to see more information (avatar_url, url, homepage url)

# Nice to Have / Future

- I'd split the repository details page into more components so they're more easily testable, this was due to time
- Add Storybook to allow easier development of individual components
- Add more testing

# Future features

- Search for a repository with debounced queries
- Pagination
- Sort repostories

# Notes

- I'd get more information from product to outline exactly what they wanted
- I chose Semantic UI to put together the page in the interests of effiency given the timeframe
- I used fetch rather than octokit - the suggested implementation for Github - for the sake of speed within the timeframe
- I've chosen a long revalidation period - once an hour - as the data doesn't change often
